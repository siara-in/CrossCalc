# Keyboard input

The mouse, keyboard and touch pad can all be used to operate the Calculator.

# Dual mode

The calculator can be used in two modes: Interactive mode and Direct expression input mode.

## Interactive mode

The interactive mode is same as any regular calculator that responds to pressing of buttons for calculations.

## Direct expression input

Alternatively, complex expressions can be composed with brackets, functions and operators, and evaluated.

# Responsive UI

The user interface automatically re-arranges the function pads according to space available on the screen, be it a mobile phone, tablet or desktop monitor.

# Functions

The functions supported by the calculator are described in the following sections:

## Basic

### Arithmetic

Basic arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷` and `.` are available as in any regular calculator.

### Brackets

Brackets can be inserted where necessary to clarify the precedence of expression evaluation.  In the absense of brackets, expressions are evaluated according to the BODMAS rule.

### Percentage

Percentage function follows any regular calculator. It works in two modes:

1. Adding or subtracting a percentage of a number.  For example, `150+10%` gives `165` and `150-10%` gives `135` as result.
2. Converting a fraction to percent.  For example, `2÷5%` gives 40 (percent).

For all other cases, using `%` function simply divides by 100.

### Correction

The correction symbol (`◅`) removes the last entered symbol from the expression for correction.

If the expression is being directly entered, using the correction symbol removes the symbol just before the current cursor position.

### Equal symbol

The `=` symbol is used to produce the result of the expression.  On the keyboard, either `=` or `Enter` key may be used.

### Plus or minus

Using `±` symbol adds a minus at the beginning of the expression.  If there is already a minus present, it removes it.

### All cancel (ac)

The `ac` pad is used to clear any expression and reset it to `0` to start calculations afresh.  On the keyboard, `Esc` key may be pressed to clear all.

## Advanced

### Square

Pressing <em>x<sup>2</sup></em> applies `sqr()` function to the current expression, multiplying it with itself.

### Square Root

Pressing `√` applies `sqrt()` function to the current expression, to find the square root of it.

### Cube

Pressing <em>x<sup>3</sup></em> applies `cube()` function to the current expression, multiplying it with itself twice.

### Cube Root

Pressing `∛` applies `cbrt()` function to the current expression, to find the cube root of it.

### Inverse

Pressing `1/x` applies `inv()` function to the current expression, to find the reciprocal of it.

### Factorial

Pressing `x!` applies `fact()` function to the current expression, to find the factorial of it.

### Natural Logarithm

Pressing `ln` applies `loge()` function to the current expression, to find the logarithm of it using base `e`.

### Decimal logarithm

Pressing <em>log<sub>10</sub></em> applies `log10()` function to the current expression, to find the logarithm of it using base 10.

### Binary Logarithm

Pressing <em>log<sub>2</sub></em> applies `log2()` function to the current expression, to find the logarithm of it using base 2.

### Natural Exponent

Pressing <em>e<sup>x</sup></em> applies `powe()` function to the current expression, to find `e` (Euler's constant) raised to the power of it.

### Power of 10

Pressing <em>10<sup>x</sup></em> applies `pow(10, x)` function to the current expression, to find `10` raised to the power of it.

### To the power of any

Pressing <em>x<sup>y</sup></em> applies `pow(x, y)` function to the current expression, to have it multiplied with itself `y` times.

### Absolute value

Pressing `|x|` applies `abs()` function to the current expression, to remove the negativity, if present.

### Permutations

Pressing <em><sup>n</sup>P<sub>r</sub></em> applies `npr(n, r)` function to the current expression, to find the number of arrangements possible for `n` elements, taken `r` at a time.

### Combinations

Pressing <em><sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub></em> applies `npr(n, r)` function to the current expression, to find the number of selections possible for `n` elements, taken `r` at a time.

### Euler's constant (e)

Pressing `e` applies function `eul()`, which returns the Euler's constant.

### Random number

Pressing `rnd` applies function `rnd()`, which returns a random number less than 1.

### Modulo operation

Pressing `mod` appends the `%` (modulo) binary operator, which returns the remainder after the first number is divided by the second.

## Programmer

### Hexadecimal keypad

A keypad with keys `1` to `9` and `A` to `F` is provided to input hexadecimal numbers. Before keying in `hex` numbers, the prefix `0x` is to be used.  Press (<em>0<sub>x</sub></em>) on the function pad or the shortcut key `x` from keyboard to prefix `0x`.

### Hexadecimal Conversion

The function pad <em>▻<sub>16</sub></em> is used to convert the current expression to Hexadecimal notation.  For this the function `toHex()` is used.

### Octal Conversion

The function pad <em>▻<sub>8</sub></em> is used to convert the current expression to Octal notation.  For this the function `toOct()` is used.

### Binary Conversion

The function pad <em>▻<sub>2</sub></em> is used to convert the current expression to Binary notation.  For this the function `toBin()` is used.

### Decimal Conversion

If the current expression is in Hex, Octal or Binary notation, pressing `=` converts it to Decimal notation.

### Boolean (bitwise) operators

`and`, `or`, `not` and `xor` are the four bitwise operators supported on the function pad. Of these, `not` is a unary operator which inverts the bits against 0xFFFFFFFF and applies the function `not()`.  The others are binary operators.

### Bit Shift operators

Bit shift binary operators `<<` (left) and `>>` (right) are used to shift bits of a given expression, a given number of times.

### Radix indication

For the purpose of entry of numbers in other bases such as hexadecimal (16), octal (8) and binary (2), three prefixes are used, viz. `0x`, `0o` and `0b` respectively.

For instance, `0xAA55` represents the decimal number `43605` in decimal and the same can be entered as `0o125125` in octal and `0b1010101001010101` in binary.

This is useful for converting between the bases and also applying bitwise operators on them.

## Trigonometric functions

### Basic

The basic functions are evaluated using the functions `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `cosec()`, `sec()` and `cot()`.  The input is assumed to be in `degrees`.

### Inverse functions

The functions <em>sin<sup>-1</sup></em>, <em>cos<sup>-1</sup></em> and <em>tan<sup>-1</sup></em> are inverses of `sin()`, `cos()` and `tan()` and are represented by `asin()`, `acos()` and `atan()` respectively.

### Hyperbolic functions

The functions `sinh()`, `cosh()`, `tanh()`, `asinh()`, `acosh()` and `atanh()` represent the hyperbolic counterparts of the circular trigonometric equivalent.

### Degree to Radian conversion

The functions `▻deg` and `▻rad` convert from degrees to radians and vice versa respectively.

## Expression recall

When the result is shown, the corresponding expression that was evaluated is also shown above it.  It may be recalled for further modification and re-evaluation by tapping on it.
