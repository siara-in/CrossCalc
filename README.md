# CrossCalc

CrossCalc is day to day Scientific Calculator that can be used on all devices.  It is available for Android phones, tablets, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows and Linux.

It asks for no permissions and does not show any ads.

The UI is simple and intuitive with functions that are used in everyday life.  It also provides many advanced functions provided by modern Scientific calculators.

# Keyboard input

The mouse, keyboard and touch pad can all be used to operate the Calculator.

# Dual mode

The calculator can be used in two modes: Interactive mode and Direct expression input mode.

## Interactive mode

The interactive mode is same as any regular calculator that responds to pressing of buttons for calculations.

## Direct expression input

Alternatively, complex expressions can be composed with brackets, functions and operators and evaluated.

# Responsive UI

The user interface automatically re-arranges the function pads according to space available on the screen, be it a mobile phone, tablet or desktop monitor.

# Functions

The functions supported by the calculator are described in the following sections:

## Basic

### Arithmetic

Basic arithmetic operators such as +, -, ×, ÷ are available as in any regular calculator.

### Brackets

Brackets can be inserted where necessary to clarify the precedence of expression evaluation.  In the absense of brackets, expressions are evaluated according to the BODMAS rule.

### Percentage

Percentage function follows any regular calculator. It works in two modes:

1. Adding or subtracting a percentage of a number.  For example, `150+10%` gives `165` and `150-10%` gives `135` as result.
2. Converting a fraction to percent.  For example, `2÷5%` gives 40 (percent).

For all other cases, using `%` function simply divides by 100.

### Correction

The correction symbol (back arrow) removes the last entered symbol from the expression for correction.

If the expression is being directly entered, using the correction symbol removes the symbol just before the current position.

### Plus or minus

Using `±` symbol adds a minus at the beginning of the expression.  If there is already a minus present, it removes it.

## Advanced

### Square

Pressing <em>x<sup>2</sup></em> applies `sqr()` function to the current expression.

### Square Root

### Cube

### Cube Root

### Inverse

### Factorial

### Natural Logarithm

### Decimal logarithm

### Binary Logarithm

### Natural Exponent

### Power of 10

### Power of any

### Absolute value

### Permutations

### Combinations

### Euler's constant (e)

### Random number

### Modulo operation

## Programmer

### Hexadecimal keypad

### Hexadecimal Conversion


## Expression recall

## All cancel (ac)
